0 : The Code-Crackin' Mind has determined that your clues so far do not accurately reflect a sequence of natural numbers with the length and upper bound you specified earlier: game cancelled.

Examples of correct marking:

Example 1:
Your code: 7 0 3 3
Guess:     4 7 3 7  you respond: 1 1
since one 3 is correct and one of the 7s is misplaced. The other 7 is incorrect (doesn't matter which).

Example 2:
Your code: 1 2 3
Guess:     1 1 1  you respond: 1 0
since one 1 is correct and the other two 1s are incorrect.

Example 3:
Your code: 1
Guess:     2  you respond: 0 0
since the 2 is incorrect.
